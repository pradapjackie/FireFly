## ‚öôÔ∏è Build and Start

### 1. Build the project:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

### 2. Review environment variables:

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Access

You can connect to the MySQL database locally at:

```

Credentials can be found in the `.env` file at the root of the project.

Your FireFly instance should now be running locally.  
You can start developing, launching tests, or working with scripts immediately.
