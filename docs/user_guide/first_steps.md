# First Steps

## Creating Your First Auto Test

After installing FireFly locally, you're ready to write your first test ðŸš€  
Just follow these **four easy steps**:

---

### 1. Create a Folder for Your Test

Create a folder in:

```
backend/src/modules/auto_test/tests
```

You can organize it by service name, team, test group â€” anything that helps with structure.  
Nested folders are fully supported.

Example:

```
backend/src/modules/auto_test/tests/examples/my_service/
```

---

### 2. Create a Python File

In the folder you just created, add an empty `.py` file.  
You can name it however you like â€” just make sure it reflects the test's purpose.

---

### 3. Add Minimal Test Code

Paste the following content:

```python
from src.modules.auto_test.register import params, register
from src.modules.auto_test.test_abs import TestAbs

@register()  # Only classes with this decorator are recognized as test classes.
class MyFirstTest(TestAbs):  # All test classes must inherit from TestAbs.
    @params(
        [
            dict(iteration_name="First"),  # Iteration name is required and shown in the UI.
        ]
    )
    async def test_success(self):
        pass  # Method name should start or end with 'test' for clarity.
```

---

### 4. Refresh the Test Tree in FireFly

Open your browser and go to the Auto Tests page, for example:

```
http://localhost/auto/examples
```

Click the **Refresh Test Tree** button.

:alt: Refresh Test Tree button
:width: 500px
```

---

### ðŸ”„ Hot Reload Mode

FireFly backend runs in **Hot Reload** mode while developing locally.  
This means every time you save changes (e.g., `Ctrl + S`), the backend restarts automatically.

> The reload may take from **1 to 20 seconds**, depending on your system.

In the backend logs, youâ€™ll see something like:

```
INFO: Shutting down
INFO: Waiting for application shutdown.
INFO: Application shutdown complete.
INFO: Finished server process
INFO: Started server process
INFO: Waiting for application startup.
INFO: Application startup complete.
```

---

### ðŸ’¡ When Should You Press Refresh?

You only need to use the **Refresh Test Tree** button if:

- New tests are **added** or **removed**
- The **path** to a test (folders/files/classes) has changed
- The test or iteration **name** has changed

In all other cases â€” like updating the logic inside a test â€” just save the file and wait a few seconds.  
Then run the updated test directly.

---

### âœ… Thatâ€™s It!

Youâ€™ve now created your first test.  
It doesnâ€™t do anything yet â€” but thatâ€™s up to you!

FireFly doesnâ€™t limit your creativity: **you can write any valid Python code** in your tests.

Next, check out the section on writing **feature-rich tests** with better reports and tooling.

## Creating Your First Script

Time to write your first **script** in FireFly ðŸš€  
Once again, it's just **four easy steps**:

---

### 1. Create a Folder for Your Script

Navigate to:

```
backend/src/modules/script_runner/scripts
```

Create a folder for your service, module, or team â€” nested folders are fully supported.

Example:

```
backend/src/modules/script_runner/scripts/examples/my_service/
```

---

### 2. Create a Python File

Add a new `.py` file in the folder you just created.  
Again, name it in a way that reflects what the script is for.

---

### 3. Add Minimal Script Code

All you need is a regular async function decorated with `@register`:

```python
from src.modules.script_runner.register import register

@register
async def my_new_script():
    pass
```

---

### 4. Refresh the Script List in FireFly

Open your browser and go to the Scripts page, for example:

```
http://localhost/script_runner/examples
```

Click the **Refresh Scripts** button.

```{image} /_static/images/first_steps_refresh_scripts.png
:alt: Refresh Scripts button
:width: 500px
```

---

### ðŸ”„ Hot Reload Mode

Just like with autotests, FireFly restarts the backend service after every file save.

> Wait a few seconds after saving before using the UI.

Only after the backend finishes reloading will the **Refresh Scripts** button update the list.

---

### ðŸ’¡ When Should You Press Refresh?

Use the **Refresh Scripts** button only if:

- New scripts are **added** or **removed**
- The **path** to a script (folder or file name) has changed
- The **function name** of the script has changed

In all other cases â€” for example, editing the body of a script â€” just save it and wait.

---

### âœ… Thatâ€™s It!

Your first script is now registered and ready to run ðŸŽ‰  
It doesnâ€™t do anything yet â€” but itâ€™s fully operational.

FireFly gives you full freedom: **any valid Python code** is allowed in scripts.
