# FireFly 🚀  
**Advanced Framework for Automated Tests, Scripts, and Load Testing**

---

## 🔥 What is FireFly?

**FireFly** is a powerful automation framework built with a Python backend and React frontend.  
It provides a complete infrastructure for running automated tests, scripts, and load tests — combining scalability, flexibility, and deep reporting through a user-friendly web interface.

Whether you need to launch simple scripts or orchestrate complex multi-service end-to-end scenarios, FireFly gives you the tools to automate at scale with full control over every detail.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📚 **Smart Test and Script Collector** — Automatically discovers and organizes tests and scripts ready to run.
- 🖥️ **Web Interface** — Select, configure, and launch tests/scripts easily with real-time execution tracking.
- 📊 **Detailed Reports** — Customizable reports with step-by-step logs, parameters, environment details, screenshots, assets, and more.
- ⚡ **Fully Asynchronous Execution** — Achieve maximum performance by running multiple tests in parallel using asyncio.
- 🔧 **Flexible Environment Configuration** — Manage environment variables and launch parameters directly through the UI.
- 🔗 **Rich Integrations** — Built-in clients for HTTP, gRPC, MySQL, ClickHouse, Selenium, Appium, and more.
- 🛠️ **Extensive Utility Toolkit** — Step manager, dynamic parameter generators, model comparison tools, asset management, and advanced logging.
- 🧩 **Python Freedom** — Write tests and scripts using full Python capabilities without unnecessary restrictions.

## 📈 When to Use FireFly

Use FireFly when:

- Your tests involve **multiple services**, databases, caches, or asynchronous communications.
- You need **calculated expected results** based on external systems rather than static values.
- You require **detailed, customizable reports** — not just "pass/fail" statuses.
- You want **fine-grained control** over your test execution, configuration, and environment management.

If your project has **outgrown** simple plug-and-play frameworks — FireFly is the next step.

## 🤔 Why FireFly?

Because modern testing requires more than just "green checkmarks."  
You need **real insights**, **full flexibility**, and **industrial-grade automation** — all in one powerful, beautiful, and developer-friendly system.

Simple scripts for generating data — users, clients, accounts, etc. — which can be run even by colleagues unfamiliar with programming thanks to a convenient UI, significantly save the QA team’s time.

Additionally, any code written for these scripts can be reused in automated tests!
